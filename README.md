# EMOGEA
**EMOGEA (Error Modeled Gene Expression Analysis )** is a computational method for the analysis of RNA-Seq gene expression data. 

The description of the method and some usage examples will soon be available upon publication.

The current **implementation** of EMOGEA is in R (this repository).

To install the package, type in the R console: 
```R
devtools::install_github("itikadi/emogeav1", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Check the vignette to see how to use the package:
```R
browseVignettes("EMOGEA")
```

It is highly recommended to use the Microsoft R Open distribution to use the package (R >= 4.0.0).
